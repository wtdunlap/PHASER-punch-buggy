## Punch Buggy Demo

This is a very crude but slightly working version of the classic roadtrip game, punch buggy. Currently there are three car types that appear in random order on random layers at random speeds to better simulate real traffic. There is no scoring system yet and there is no way to actually interface with the game. This is a work in progress.
